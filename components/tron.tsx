                <Image alt="" src={m9} />


<p>Tron uses a <strong>Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</strong> consensus mechanism where <strong>27 elected Super Representatives</strong> are responsible for <strong>validating transactions, creating new blocks, and securing the network</strong>. These SRs receive <strong>voting rewards and block rewards</strong> as compensation for their role.</p>

<h2 className={subtitle()}>2. Censorship Resistance:</h2>

<p>The majority of the 27 SR entities are located in the United States, necessitating compliance with regulatory frameworks such as the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).</p>

<h2 className={subtitle()}>3. Liveliness:</h2>

<p>The Tron network suffers from a <strong>single point of failure</strong> when it comes to client software. Currently, <strong>all SRs utilize the same software, java-tron</strong>. If a critical vulnerability were discovered in this software, it could potentially <strong>halt the entire Tron network</strong>. On November 2nd, 2021, the network was <strong>paused for 2 hours</strong> due to a `&quot;`malicious contract`&quot;` targeting an SR.</p>

<h2 className={subtitle()}>4. Governance:</h2>

<p>While the Tron network allows <strong>anyone to propose improvements</strong> through Github, the ultimate decision on <strong>network upgrades and updates</strong> rests primarily with the <strong>Tron Core team</strong>. This <strong>centralized decision-making</strong> structure contradicts the core principles of decentralization and limits community involvement in shaping the network&apos;s future.</p>
